### INPUT DATA
- G - consumption of air
- $\pi_k$ - Overall degree of pressure increase
- $P_H$ - outside atmospheric pressure
- $T_H$ - outside temperature
- $\delta_{BX}$ - Total pressure recovery coefficient
- $\eta_K$ - Compressor overall efficiency


### Selecting parameters
- $\rho_{k1}$ - degree of reactivity
    > range (0.55 - 0.6)
